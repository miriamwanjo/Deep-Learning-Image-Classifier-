# image-classifier
Using deep learning to train an image classifier to recognize different species of flowers.
Load a pre-trained network 
Define a new, untrained feed-forward network as a classifier, using ReLU activations and dropout
Train the classifier layers using backpropagation using the pre-trained network to get the features
Track the loss and accuracy on the validation set to determine the best hyperparameters
Test the network
Use the model to predict the image provided.
